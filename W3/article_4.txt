The next great smartphone showdown is already brewing, and it’s between Apple iPhone 18 and Samsung Galaxy S26. Neither phone is expected to launch until 2026, but early leaks from both camps have already set the tech world abuzz. From Apple’s possible redesign and ultra-efficient 2-nanometre chips to Samsung’s brighter displays and upgraded cameras, the stage is being set for yet another head-to-head between the two titans of mobile technology.

While both brands are known for keeping secrets until the last possible moment, industry insiders have given us a glimpse of what may lie ahead. Here’s everything we know so far about the next generation of iPhones and Galaxy flagships.

iPhone 18: Specs, features, price and more

The iPhone 18 series is already shaping up to be one of Apple’s most significant leaps in years. Following the release of the iPhone 17 lineup, which introduced the ultra-slim iPhone Air and 120Hz ProMotion displays across models, Apple is reportedly preparing to go even thinner and sleeker with the iPhone 18 family.

According to early leaks, the lineup will consist of iPhone 18, iPhone 18e, iPhone 18 Pro, and iPhone 18 Pro Max, though plans for an iPhone Air 2 may be on hold. What’s more, Apple could be changing up its usual release rhythm. For the first time in over a decade, the company may split its launches across two events.

Reports from ETNews claim that the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max, alongside the long-rumoured iPhone Fold, will arrive in September 2026, sticking to Apple’s classic autumn unveiling window. However, the iPhone 18 and 18e could arrive months later in Spring 2027, possibly around March.

At the heart of the new lineup is the expected A20 Bionic chip, built on a next-generation 2-nanometre process. This chipset promises huge gains in efficiency and AI processing power, helping Apple deliver smarter features powered by Apple Intelligence. Users can expect more advanced on-device generative AI, improved Siri performance, and new creative tools such as text-to-image generation, some of which could be based on Google Gemini integration.

Camera upgrades are also part of the rumour mill, though not all may debut at once. Supply chain sources suggest that Apple might delay one of its major sensor-level camera enhancements until the iPhone 19 in 2027. Still, minor improvements to colour accuracy, image processing, and low-light capture are expected this year.

Design-wise, the iPhone 18 will continue Apple’s new design philosophy, taking cues from the iPhone Air’s ultra-slim aesthetic with thinner bezels, a more compact body, and stronger materials. The phones are also expected to feature next-generation OLED panels with higher brightness levels and improved power efficiency.

The wildcard, however, remains the iPhone Fold. Said to resemble “two titanium iPhone Airs joined together”, it could mark Apple’s entry into the foldable market with a price tag that reportedly starts north of $2,000 (approximately Rs 1.66 lakh).

If Apple delivers on these rumours, the iPhone 18 lineup could represent a new era, one defined by smarter software, cutting-edge chipsets, and a shift in how the company spaces out its releases.

Samsung Galaxy S26: What is coming and what to expect

Over on the Android side, Samsung is also gearing up for its next big release — the Galaxy S26 series — which is expected to arrive early in 2026, most likely in January or February. The Galaxy S26 lineup will reportedly stick to the familiar formula, with the S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra, though there’s still some speculation about whether a Galaxy Edge edition could return.

Samsung’s focus appears to be on refining the experience rather than reinventing it. According to insiders, the new models will get larger displays, bigger batteries, and more powerful AI capabilities, all powered by either the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 or Samsung’s in-house Exynos 2600 chip, depending on the region.

The standard Galaxy S26 is rumoured to feature a 6.27-inch display, slightly larger than its predecessor, paired with a 4,300mAh battery. The S26 Ultra could retain its 6.9-inch screen but offer a lighter frame and potentially a 5,400mAh battery, though some sources say it could stay at 5,000mAh. Charging speeds may finally see an upgrade, with reports suggesting 60W fast charging on the Ultra model, up from the long-standing 45W limit.

Samsung is also said to be adopting M14 OLED displays, the same high-end panels used by Apple and Google, promising even brighter screens and better energy efficiency. On the software front, expect One UI 8 with deeper AI integration, building on Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform. The company is reportedly exploring partnerships with third-party AI tools like Perplexity, in addition to existing integrations with Gemini and Bixby.

Camera upgrades are another big talking point. The base Galaxy S26 could retain its 50-megapixel main sensor, but with a larger and more light-sensitive sensor, while the Ultra model might take things further with a rumoured 200-megapixel telephoto camera and a 324-megapixel main sensor, though that last number sounds almost too ambitious, even for Samsung. The Ultra may also bring back variable aperture, a feature not seen on Galaxy phones since 2019, potentially allowing users to adjust how much light enters the lens for more creative shots.

On the software and AI side, Samsung’s Exynos 2600 chip is expected to enhance image signal processing, improving photos even if the sensor hardware remains unchanged.

Both Apple and Samsung seem to be chasing the same future, one defined by AI-powered smartphones, next-generation displays, and premium materials. The iPhone 18 is leaning into efficiency, smarter intelligence, and new form factors, while the Galaxy S26 is betting on improved camera tech and fast AI integration.

One thing is certain, 2026 is shaping up to be a massive year for flagship phones, with both brands set to push boundaries in power, design, and price. Whether you’re team iPhone or Galaxy, the next battle for smartphone supremacy is already on the horizon.

- Ends
